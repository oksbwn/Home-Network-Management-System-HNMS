## 📘 Detailed Usage Guide

### 📊 Dashboard & Analytics
The Hub for your network health.
- **Sparklines**: Integrated trend lines within metric cards reveal 24-hour activity patterns.
- **Live Feed**: Pulsing activity log monitors current worker status.

### ⚙️ Rule Management
Located in **Settings**, the classification engine allows you to:
- **Prioritize Identification**: Ensure high-priority rules match before generic ones.
- **Regex Support**: Match devices by Hostname, Vendor, or common local ports.
- **Icon Selector**: Choose from a premium Lucide-based icon library.

### 🔍 Device Management
- **Audit Trigger**: Initiate manual scans to force a directory refresh.
- **Deep Audit**: Probes 1000+ ports; captures banner metadata for precise identification.

### 📡 MQTT Integration & Automation
HNMS acts as a bridge between your network and your smart home.

> [!TIP]
> Use the **Home Assistant Discovery** feature to instantly see network presence as binary sensors in your HA Dashboard.

![Home Assistant Discovery](./.img/HA%20Dsicovery.png)

| Topic Pattern | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `{base}/device/{mac}/state` | Broadcasts `home` / `not_home`. |
| `{base}/device/{mac}/attributes` | Rich JSON containing IP, Vendor, and OS details. |

## 🚀 Quick Start (Docker)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Linux deployments, use `network_mode: host` in `docker-compose.yml` to allow the scanner full access to the network interface.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Access at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

---

## 💻 Manual Development Setup

### Backend (FastAPI)
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

### Frontend (Vue 3)
```bash
cd ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🛠️ Windows Troubleshooting

If device discovery is not working on your Windows machine, please check the following:

### 1. Install Npcap
The scanner uses Scapy, which requires a packet capture driver on Windows. 
- Download and install **[Npcap](https://npcap.com/#download)**.
- During installation, ensure the **"Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible Mode"** option is checked.

### 2. Run as Administrator
Sending raw network packets (ARP) requires high-level privileges. 
- Open your terminal (PowerShell or CMD) as **Administrator** before running the uvicorn command.

### 3. Automatic Fallback
The system includes a smart fallback. If raw ARP packets are restricted by your security policy, HNMS will automatically pivot to a **Parallel Ping Sweep**. This ensures devices are found even without specialized drivers.
